## 🎯 Why Frizzball?

Traditional weather apps don't understand how atmospheric conditions affect different hair types. Frizzball bridges this gap by:

- **Combining Meteorology + Trichology**: Weather science meets hair science
- **Personalized Algorithms**: Your 2B low-porosity hair gets different advice than 4A high-porosity hair  
- **Real-World Actionable**: Specific product recommendations and styling techniques
- **Accuracy-Focused**: Uses reliable weather APIs with proper dew point calculations

## 📱 Usage Examples

### For 3B High Porosity Hair on a Humid Day:
- *"High porosity hair needs extra moisture - use leave-in conditioner"*
- *"High humidity day - perfect for gel scrunching method for your 3B curls"*
- *"Seal with a light oil to prevent moisture loss"*

### For 2A Low Porosity Hair in Dry Conditions:
- *"Low porosity + dry air: Use lightweight, water-based products only"*
- *"Pre-heat products in your palms for better absorption"*
- *"Perfect weather for air drying with scrunching technique"*
